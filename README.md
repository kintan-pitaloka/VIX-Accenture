# Accenture Virtual Internship Program - Task 2 and Task 3

This repository contains the work and findings from my virtual internship experience with Accenture, focusing on Task 2 and Task 3. The objective was to analyze content categories and identify the top 5 categories with the largest popularity based on reaction scores.

## Project Overview

The client requested an analysis of their content categories, specifically identifying the top 5 categories with the highest popularity. Popularity was quantified by the "Score" assigned to each reaction type. The tasks involved cleaning the data, merging relevant tables, and calculating the total scores for each category to determine the top 5 performing categories.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/accenture-internship-task2-task3.git
    cd accenture-internship-task2-task3
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Open Jupyter Notebook:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. **Run the analysis:**

    Open the notebook and run the cells to perform the data cleaning, merging, and analysis.

## Analysis

To determine the top 5 performing categories:

1. **Calculate Total Scores**: Sum the reaction scores for each category.
2. **Identify Top 5 Categories**: Select the top 5 categories with the highest total scores.
