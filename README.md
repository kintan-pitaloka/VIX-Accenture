# Accenture-Virtual Intern

ACCENTURE VIRTUAL INTERNSHIP PROGRAM-TASK 2 and Task 3

The brief carefully states that the client wanted to see
“An analysis of their content categories showing the top 5 categories with the largest popularity”.

As the data model explains, popularity is quantified by the “Score” given to each reaction type. We, therefore, need data showing the content ID, category, content type, reaction type, and reaction score. So, to figure out popularity, we’ll have to add up which content categories have the most significant score.

Clean the data by:
removing rows that have values that are missing,
changing the data type of some values within a column, and
removing columns that are not relevant to this task.
Think about how each column might be relevant to the business question you’re investigating. If you can’t think of why a column may be useful, it may not be worth including it.

Create a final data set by merging your three tables together
Figure out the Top 5 performing categories
Add up the total scores for each category.

The end result should be one spreadsheet that contains:
A cleaned dataset The top 5 categories
